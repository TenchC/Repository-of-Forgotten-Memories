# Repository-of-Forgotten-Memories

The Repository of forgotten memories is an experimental piece I made as a reflection on the people who had a large impact on my life.
I wanted to make a website that felt like a non-linear web ecxperience, so each random rectangle is a link to a different part of the website.
Each page is dedicated to an individual person.
